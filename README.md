### __Description__: 
Remaining useful life has been recently research in the field of Time Series Prediction in general and especially in Engineering. </br> </br>
The goal is to minimize the budget spending on maintaining object. By using Machine Learning and Data Analysis techniques, engineers can optimize the plan for maintainance stuff. This would help them easier to control the schedule as well as prepare for the future plans.

### __Models to use__: 
* Multi-linear Time Series Prediction
* Long-Short Term Memory RNN
  * Stacked LSTM
  * Vanilla LSTM
* Deep Multi-output Random Forest
* Tuning Gradient Boost and Random Forest


### __Libraries__:
* Tensorflow / Keras
* Numpy / Pandas
* Scikit-learn (sklearn)
* Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly

### __Project Structures__:

### __Files Structures__:
~~~
   /Dataset: contains project data 
   /Models:  source codes for each of the models 
   /Preprocess: source codes for preprocessing and cleaning part 
   /Analysis: notebooks contains analysis information
   /Evaluation: evaluate the models after build
~~~
